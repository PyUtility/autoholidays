[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [PEP0440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
styling guide. For full details, see the [commit logs](https://github.com/PyUtility/autoholidays/commits).

## `PEP0440` Styling Guide

<details>
<summary>Click to open <code>PEP0440</code> Styilng Guide</summary>

Packaging for `PyPI` follows the standard PEP0440 styling guide and is implemented by the **`packaging.version.Version`** class. The other
popular versioning scheme is [`semver`](https://semver.org/), but each build has different parts/mapping.
The following table gives a mapping between these two versioning schemes:

<div align = "center">

| `PyPI` Version | `semver` Version |
| :---: | :---: |
| `epoch` | n/a |
| `major` | `major` |
| `minor` | `minor` |
| `micro` | `patch` |
| `pre` | `prerelease` |
| `dev` | `build` |
| `post` | n/a |

</div>

One can use the **`packaging`** version to convert between PyPI to semver and vice-versa. For more information, check

### AutoHolidays v1.0.0 | 2026-03-11

I'm pleased to announce the first stable release of **`autoholidays`** a module dedicated towards finding the ideal
holidays based on a group of individual(s) leaves, weekly-offs and regional holiday list. This is a hobby project, that
I'd embarked to automate the leave planning for me and my *better half*, but obviously sky is the limit!

The package is available in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/autoholidays/) and can be installed using `pip` as
below:

```
pip install -U autoholidays
```

The module can be used by both an individual and a group of individuals. The initial version gives a raw package to
*play-around*, uses manual insertion of holidays and other details to calculate optimum holidays.
